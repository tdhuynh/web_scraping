# web_scraping

This assigment introduced web scraping and the pros and cons of it. 
I needed to create an application that scraped data from a guitar tablature to provide an ad-free experience for the user.

# Features:
* Proxy requests from your site to an external resource
* Scrape HTML data with Beautiful Soup and parse out important elements
* Explore methods to optimize the performance of your site
* Allow an anonymous (non logged in user) to search for a song name
* Display the search results as a clickable link that does NOT take you away from your site.
  * (links that take you to the external site are allowed but are required to be marked as such)
* The link should take you to an internal page on your site and show an advertisement free experience where a user can easily read the guitar tablature.
